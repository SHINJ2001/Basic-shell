# Basic-shell
Works like any shell, but does not work in raw mode. Can handle prorgam interrupts, fg, bg, jobs commands, pipes,
program execution along with options and arguments
Does have the history command but pressing the up key does not let you browse you through the history. Can change the prompt to whatever you want.
